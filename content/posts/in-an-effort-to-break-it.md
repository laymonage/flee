I am writing this post. A post that's not quite like the others.

<!--more-->

You see, we create patterns in our lives. Consciously or not.

Some patterns make it easy to live through the day. Some make it mundane.

I'm not saying it's bad. Some routines, as mundane as they seem, are necessary.

Are you seeing it now? It's a pattern. A pattern yang mulai hilang ketika ada yang
menyadari itu. Apakah harus sadar dulu for that pattern to be gone? Entah. Ya, tp kyknya
hidup lebih berwarna if there weren't so many patterns. Iya, jadi lebih unpredictable. But
it can give you the thrills. Lebih seru aja kayaknya.

So, yeah. Pola. Patterns. Coba perhatikan sekeliling, maybe you can find some that you didn't notice before.
